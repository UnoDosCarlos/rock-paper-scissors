# rock-paper-scissors

This project was designed to assist in developing logic and using Javascripts various resources to create a simple game. The biggest take aways are being able to recall a choice function to get new results from new inputs, using "if" statements to create the logic for the game, and remember to make smaller commits while working on any project.
